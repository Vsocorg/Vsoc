					<div class="profile-info">
				<p> <b>Age:</b> 61 y.o.</p>
				<p> <b>Profession: </b>photographer</p>
				<p>  <b>Location:</b> Odessa</p>
				<p> <b>About:</b> I had started to work as a weekend sports photographer in 1983. In 1984, he moved on to work for the Johannesburg Star, went on exposing the brutality of apartheid.
	Carter was the first to photograph a public execution "necklacing" by black Africans in South Africa in the mid-1980s. Carter later spoke of the images: "I was appalled at what they were doing. But then people started talking about those pictures... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn't been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn't necessarily such a bad thing to do.
